  <!-- Fun Section: Exotic Dance -->
  <h4>🕺 Exotic Dance Moves</h4>
  <p>
    Indeed! During my postdoctoral work, I studied traditional dances from around the world. Here are my favorites:
  </p>

  <!-- Dance Types List with Fun Facts -->
  <ul>
    <li><b>Polynesian Chicken Dance</b><br>
      An ancient cultural dance (around 300 BC) where villagers move in a circle imitating chickens 🐔 — believed to encourage productivity in livestock.
    </li>
    <li><b>Icelandic Brownian Shuffle</b><br>
      This dance originated in cold climates. People huddled and shuffled on the floor to stay warm — some say it led to modern moves like twerking.
    </li>
    <li><b>Arctic Robot Dance</b><br>
      A stiff movement style observed in 1960s Northern Alaska and Canada. Early researchers thought it was a new dance, but it was actually due to cold weather!
    </li>
  </ul>
